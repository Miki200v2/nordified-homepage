# nordified-homepage
Nordified version of Nathaniel Evan's custom browser homepage made. Inspired by various sources. Made with vanilla HTML-CSS-JS and designed with responsiveness in mind, originally based on Gruvbox Material colours by [@sainnhe](https://github.com/sainnhe). Nordified by [@Miki200v2](https://github.com/Miki200v2)

Live preview can be accessed [here](https://miki200v2.github.io/nordified-homepage/).
